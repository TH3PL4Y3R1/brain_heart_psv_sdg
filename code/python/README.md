# Python translations (placeholder)

This folder will host Python translations of the MATLAB implementation.

Status: not implemented yet.

Planned structure:

- core model (numpy/scipy) equivalent of `model_psv_sdg.m`
- utilities for CSI/CVI computation equivalent to `compute_CSI_CVI.m`
- optional I/O adapters and plotting helpers

If you’re interested in contributing, please open an issue with your intended design and dependencies.
